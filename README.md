# Advent of Code 2024

I will be attempting [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) again this year. I will stick to Python for my solutions, but my goals this year are to be a little smarter and to not always implement the first solution I think of. I'll also attempt to remember my graph theory...

**Note**: the author of AoC has [requested](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) that people do not add their puzzle input, or parts of the puzzle text, to public repositories, so if you want to try out my solutions you'll have to log in and get your own puzzle inputs.
